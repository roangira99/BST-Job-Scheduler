<h1> Job Scheduler Project</h1>
<p>The program's main functionality is to schedule daily jobs that run at a given time of the day. <br>
Binary Search Tree logic was used to implement the program based on the need to schedule
and run jobs asynchronously. 
</p>
<h3>Project Specifications:</h3>
<p>• Includes a load file that contains jobs which need to be loaded by the program for
scheduling. <br>
   • Maintained order after modification of job details through interface e.g scheduling a 
job or removing a scheduled job. <br>
   • Jobs can only be run asynchronously, each at a given time and without any overlap. <br>
   • Dynamic update of load file as to reflect any modifications done on jobs. 
e.g add, delete job
